Description: 'TWConventions' provides utilities for encoding and enforcing conventions and semantic meaning 
    of TiddlyWiki tiddler titles, fields, and tags. It includes functions to handle canonical 
    names, alternative names (aka), project-specific inclusion rules, and other structured 
    assumptions about TiddlyWiki content. The package allows R scripts and projects to reliably 
    interpret TiddlyWiki data according to standardized conventions without depending on 
    transport or workflow mechanisms.
